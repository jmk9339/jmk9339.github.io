      <p class="lead">
        Hello, my name is Jared, I am 22 years old based in New York. 
        I am a fourth-year Cyber Security student at Rochester Institute of Technology, soon to graduate with my Bachelor's degree. 
        I have a strong passion for cybersecurity and game development that I have developed experience in through education and personal projects. 
        <br><br>
        With most of my time spent behind a computer screen, I have developed a strong interest in gaming and game development, which has led me to create games on the Roblox platform. 
        For the past four years, I have improved by object oriented programming skills and have developed a strong understanding of game design and development principles. 
        Game development has taught me technical expertise in not just coding, but in 3D design, animation, and sound design, as well as soft skills such as project management, teamwork, and communication.
        <br><br>
        I am best known for my strong work ethic, constantly challenging myself to perfect the projects I take on.
        I have experience in various programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and Lua, and have worked on projects ranging from penetration testing of company networks to creating and deploying red team tools.
