        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p class="project-subtext"><em>Cyber Defense Techniques Course @ RIT – Fall 2025</em></p>
        <p>
          The Chernobyl competition focused on pitting teams against each other in a traditional red vs blue team framework. 
          There were three blue teams, each separately scored, creating a need for the red team to apply pressure on three fronts. 
          I was one of nine members on the red team for this competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created a Systemd persistence tool for Linux-based machines by writing an Ansible playbook that deploys a payload, initializes my fake service, and adds my ssh key to the given list of users.

        <h2>Issues & Conflict</h2>
        <p>
          As a team, we had not communicated enough both before and during the competition. 
          The issue caused team members to lose access to hosts, heavy bias with numerous services going down for just one team, and one Windows box became unavailable for the remainder of the day. 
          If we had planned for the competition in a more sophisticated manner, we could have better prepared each team member’s red team tool.

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
          Our actions and tasks should have been better communicated amongst each other to help the team avoid overlap and reduce friction between members. 
          It would have been best to inform the team of what I was working on, how I could help, or when I required help.
          Learning and planning attack vectors ahead of the competition could have allowed our team to produce a more impartial competition as well.
